# My First Project After a Coding Break ðŸš€

Welcome to my first web project after taking a break from coding! After months of doubt and uncertainty, I've finally decided to return to my passion for development. This project marks the start of my journey back into the tech world, with a long-term goal of transitioning into **Web3 development**.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

This website is a personal project I created as a way to reintroduce myself to the world of web development. It's a simple static website, but it's meaningful to me as it represents my determination to move forward as a developer. 

Key features:
- Responsive design using **Tailwind CSS**
- Smooth animations with **AOS (Animate On Scroll)**
- Custom fonts from **Google Fonts**
- Simple, elegant styling
- Dynamic hover effects and transitions

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

This project is built using:
- **HTML5**: For the website structure.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for fast and responsive styling.
- **AOS (Animate on Scroll)**: For smooth scroll-based animations.
- **Google Fonts**: Custom fonts to enhance the design.

ðŸ”¥ What I Learned
This project helped me get back into the coding groove and:

Refamiliarize myself with HTML/CSS.
Learn how to integrate and customize Tailwind CSS.
Explore basic scroll animations using AOS.
Gain more confidence in my ability to develop and style responsive websites.
ðŸŽ¯ Future Goals
While this project is a great start, my ultimate goal is to dive deeper into development, eventually transitioning into Web3. Here's what's next for me:

Learn JavaScript thoroughly to add dynamic interactivity to websites.
Start experimenting with smart contracts and blockchain technology.
Build more complex projects involving Web3 dApps and decentralized technologies.
ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
After months of hesitation, I've come to realize that doubt and fear are part of every journey, but the only way to grow is to push through them. This project is a symbol of my renewed commitment to my development journey, and I'm excited to see where this path will take me.

âœ¨ About Me
I'm Alvin, a developer passionate about exploring technology and eager to transition into the Web3 ecosystem. This project is the first step of many as I work towards mastering both traditional web development and the decentralized future.
